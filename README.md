# AuditDefense
A Linux Auditd rules configuration mapped to MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Notes

However this rule set can be ideal for forensics or real-time detection, it can generates a lot of logs. So please ensure you have enough available space (or configure log rotation) and sufficient hardware ressources.
